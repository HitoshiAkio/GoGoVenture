Your existence has been logged, reviewed, and flagged for deletion.
The date has been set: <span class="there"><?= $date ?></span>, a day that has already been written, long before you were born.<br>
There is no escape from what has already been decided.
The clock does not tick for you anymore...<br>
it only waits.
You will not hear footsteps behind you.
You will not see the shadow in the corner.
But you will feel it... standing where your reflection should be
You are already gone at the age of <span class="there"><?= $number?></span>.
You just haven't stopped breathing yet.
